# Cryptanalysis
This repository aims to be a directory of basic stuff used in cryptanalysis.

## freq_anaysis.c
* A first attempt of a frequency analysis tool.
* It does not detect bigrams nor trigrams that helps the cryptanalysis. Therefore, this tool should be efficient only if the input text is long enough and if the letter distribution is similar to the input language reference.
* Implented for the following languages:
  * English.
  * French: to be done based on a Wikip√©dia article (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9quence_d'apparition_des_lettres_en_fran%C3%A7ais). I need to verify if all characters do have ASCII codes.
  * Accorded to a friend, Markov chains seems to be a good solution. Some references:
    * [Diaconis, The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution.](http://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf)
    * [Chen et al., Decrypting Classic Cipher Text Using Markov Chains Monte Carlo](http://probability.ca/jeff/ftpdir/decipherart.pdf)

## freq_anaysis_pointer.c
EXACTLY the same goal: pointers are used instead of arrays, that's all.
